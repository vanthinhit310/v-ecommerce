## Install on hosting

- Upload all files into the root folder of your hosting (normally, it is`public_html`).
- Create a database and import data from `database.sql` (it's located in source code).
- Create `.env` from `.env.example` and update your database credentials.
- Make sure `APP_URL` in `.env` is correct your domain. It should be `APP_URL=http://your-domain.com`
- Go to `/admin` to access to admin panel.
- The default admin account is admin@gistensal.com - Viweb@@1234.
